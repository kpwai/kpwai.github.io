											<h2>Education</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, followed by an Honours degree in same discipline that provided advanced theoretical grounding. I further pursued a Master’s degree in Computer Science, deepening my expertise in computational methodologies and research practices. I completed my academic training with a PhD in Information Technology, where I engaged in extensive research and contributed to the advancement of knowledge in the field. All of these degrees were obtained from the University of Computer Studies, Mandalay (UCSM), Myanmar, reflecting a continuous and coherent academic progression within a consistent scholarly environment.</p>
										<header class="major">
											<h2>Research Interest</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">My research interests lie broadly in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven computational methods. I am particularly interested in data science and data-driven approaches for processing and analyzing different types of data, with a focus on extracting meaningful patterns and supporting evidence-based insights. I am also interested in the development of interpretable and explainable models, intelligent decision-making systems, and analytical frameworks that enhance the transparency and reliability of AI. Overall, my work explores how advanced computational techniques can be applied to complex datasets to improve predictive performance, strengthen interpretability, and enable responsible, human-centered applications of AI across diverse domains.</p>

											<h2>Research Experience</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">During my PhD’s studies, I investigated distance-based clustering of moving-object trajectories using large-scale trajectory datasets, examining how similarity measures and spatio-temporal characteristics can be used to uncover meaningful mobility patterns. This work strengthened my understanding of high-dimensional data analysis and the development of clustering methodologies capable of handling complex and voluminous movement data. Building on this foundation, my postdoctoral research focused on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), with an emphasis on developing interpretable models and analytical frameworks that provide transparent insights into Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Models. This experience expanded my interest in model interpretability, intelligent decision-making processes, and the integration of statistical learning with explainable computational techniques. Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at the School of Economic, Singapore Management University (SMU), where I apply data-driven approaches and machine learning methods to process and analyze diverse datasets, and derive actionable insights for the economic doamin.</p>
										<header class="major">
											<h2>Teaching Experience</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align: justify;">I have gained extensive teaching experience through my involvement in both undergraduate and postgraduate instruction across a range of computing disciplines. I have taught Information Technology Passport (IP) and Fundamental Information Technology Engineer (FE) courses, supporting students preparing for the professional IT proficiency examinations administered by the Information-Technology Promotion Agency (IPA), Japan. My teaching portfolio also includes core computing courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, Database Systems, Information Processing Systems, Information System Strategy, and Security. As part of an established teaching team, I have additionally contributed to the delivery of advanced modules including Multi-Agent Systems, Data Mining, and Machine Learning. My responsibilities have encompassed developing teaching materials, preparing and evaluating assessments, addressing students’ learning challenges, providing guidance on study skills, offering constructive feedback, and conducting mock tests to support students’ academic and professional development.</p>
